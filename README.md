# AIDANTOKEN

This was my first try at building an ETC20 token. 

Code based on that provided by Juan Cruz Martinez in his article from Medium.com (https://medium.com/better-programming/create-and-deploy-your-own-erc-20-token-on-the-ethereum-network-87931fe4db20). 

My token has a supply of 1000, with a minimum value of 0.1 **AIDAN TOKEN**, meaning there are 100 **AIDAN TOKENs**. 
I have deployed the coin on the Ropsten test-net using the Remix Ethereum IDE and MetaMask. 

Coin Contract Information: 
Symbol: AJR
Name: AIDAN TOKEN
Total supply: 1000
Decimals: 1
